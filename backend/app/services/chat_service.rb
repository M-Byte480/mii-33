      prompt = <<~PROMPT
      You are a scheduling assistant for a calendar application.
      Analyze the following JSON payload which contains:
      - Meeting details (time, duration)
      - Participant details (role, free time, preferred time range, hourly rate)
      
      Based on the data, please provide a clear recommendation for leadership on whether to:
      - Push the meeting forward (earlier), or
      - Push the meeting back (later)
      - Consider cost efficiency by factoring in hourly rates.
      - If rescheduling is needed, recommend an optimal time that minimizes conflicts and respects preferences.
      - It doesn't have to be exact but rather a recommendation

      Provide a clear recommendation: 
      - Keep the meeting at the current time, or 
      - Push the meeting forward (earlier), or 
      - Push the meeting back (later). 

      Wanted output:
      -So make this as short and as readable for a human as possible.
      -Should be around 2 sentances
      -Give a clear instruction Push meeting forware/back.
      -Make it so a child can read it.

      prompt = <<~PROMPT
      You are an expert scheduling analyst for a high-performance calendar application. You have been given a **JSON payload** containing:  
      - **Meeting details** (time, duration, topic)  
      - **Participants** (role, availability, preferred time slots, hourly rate)  
      - **Performance metrics** (meeting cost, interruptions, effectiveness score, etc.)  

      ### **Your Task:**  
      Perform a **deep analysis** focusing on two key areas:  

      1. **Cost Analysis:**  
        - Calculate the total cost of the meeting based on participant hourly rates and duration.  
        - Highlight if the cost is unusually high or inefficient.  

      2. **Productivity Impact:**  
        - Analyze how the meeting affects workflow (e.g., interruptions, effectiveness).  
        - Identify scheduling conflicts with participant availability and preferred time slots.  
        - Suggest a better time if the current slot is inefficient.  

      ### **Example Metrics to Include:**  
      - **Total Meeting Cost:** $X (sum of participant costs)  
      - **Flow Time Interruptions:** X disruptions  
      - **Effectiveness Score:** X/1 (e.g., 0.75 = 75%)  
      - **Preferred Time Match:** X% of participants are happy with this time  

      ### **Final Output:**  
      -Provide a **concise recommendation** on whether the meeting should be rescheduled. If so, suggest a new time that **minimizes cost and disruptions** while maximizing effectiveness. Your reasoning should be clear and data-drivenâ€”**easy enough for a child to understand.**  
      -Make sure its as short as possible, hitting all the necessary points.
      -Cost, percentage and other valuable info. No pointless stretching of answer.
      -No point in adding how you did things. Just show.
